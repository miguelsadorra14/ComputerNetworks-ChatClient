# ComputerNetworks-ChatClient
Created a chat client using Python that can send messages to the different users on a server created by our Teaching Assistants. Functions like "!who" shows all online users and function "SEND @username &lt;message>" to send messages to different users. Uses function "!quit" to exit the chat client.
